Join the GDG platform

All developers and those interested in Google technologies or in becoming a developer are welcome to join the GDG platform. Before getting started, read the “About” page to learn more about the platform.

To become an organizer of an existing GDG chapter:
Contact the current GDG organizer(s) of the chapter to express interest. You can get in touch via Meetup.com or in-person at one of the chapter events.
If you don’t currently have a Meetup.com account, create one. Then, ask the current organizer of your chapter to add you as an organizer on their GDG Meetup.com page.
Once you’re marked as an organizer, we’ll add you to our communication channels and email you a Non-Disclosure Agreement for your review and e-signature. This NDA allows us to share details with you about the GDG program and Google Developers initiatives.
(Optional) Follow the Google Developers company page on LinkedIn.
(Optional) Add GDG to your LinkedIn profile:
Follow the GDG Showcase page.
Add a Volunteer section to your profile.
Type and add “GDG” under the Organization section.
